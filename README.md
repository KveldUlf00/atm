# Welcome to my project!

Hi! My name is Błażej Raducki. I hope that everything work fine, below I described interesting information about the project

# How to run project

### `npm start`

maybe it will be also usefull:

### `npm install`

## My Node and Npm version

### `Node: 18.17.1`

### `Npm: 6.14.4`

## Implementation

I tried my best to perform the task assigned to me. Perhaps I had a little too much fun using "store". In my opinion, all the required elements are completed. If for someone my view of ATM is not the most beautiful then I apologize, usually UX layouts save me :)

Elements visible in the preview are almost always clickable (just like in real life), but are functional only when necessary.

All delays ("Processing...") are implemented specifically to best represent reality.

The design is responsive up to 380px screen width.

## Possible implementation incompatibilities

Display to show account balance - In my application, this can be previewed by going to "Balance" and selecting "Print balance" there. I hope that my interpretation of the preview is not something very wrong. I wanted to replicate the operation of the ATM as much as possible, and there such a cool preview of the balance is not there ;)
